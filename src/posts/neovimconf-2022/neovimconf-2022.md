# NeovimConf 2022

VimConf has returned after its inaugural year, already getting a rebrand!

If its first year had a theme, it was probably the adoption of lua, both preferring init.lua to init.vim and writing plugins in lua. This year I would characterize the theme as embracing plugins: build them, install them, lock them, and make sure you build them in lua. The surprising, at least to me, Zeitgeist word of the year was [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) which just kept popping up.

I like the direction the conference is going. Despite the new name and any confusion it caused, it was nice to see editor diversity in this year's line-up. I hope to see more in the future, and it might lead to bigger conferences in the future.

One constant between this and last year's conference is that while the talks were again great, imparting deeper insight into the editor I use every day, the real purpose of attending a gathering of vimers is to walk away with an undeniable urge to throw out and then rewrite all my config files better than ever, and to take down a list of very interesting plugins or dotfile repos that I absolutely want to use and will definitely get to one day.
